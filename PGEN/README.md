Title: PGEN

Abstract: PGEN is a general purpose parser generator

Author: G. Florijn, G.Rolf

Description: PGEN is a parser generator, that generates recursive descent parsers with automatic error recovery.
The input for PGEN is a LL(1) grammar written in a powerful, BNF-like meta-language.
This grammar can be augmented with user-defined actions for building parse-trees, generating code etc. 
PGEN generates a recursive descent parser, which contains suitable error recevery operations and error messages.
The resulting program is a SUMMER program.
